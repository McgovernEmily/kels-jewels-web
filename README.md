# kels-jewels-web
Created my sister a website to sell her jewelry.
This was my first project working with HTML and CSS. I created a site plan before I started programming.
Gave in skills in continuing to learn how to use HTML and CSS together. Gave me skills working with a personal client who asked me to create the website. 

I plan to go back and finish making it better since I have grown in my skills in HTML and CSS
